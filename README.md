# Task:

You have chosen the products you want to buy and want to take advantage of this offer to save as much money as possible. Of course, the amount you have to pay depends on the order in which you buy the goods. Knowing the price of each product, as well as the percentage of the discount, calculate the most advantageous amount for which you can buy all the products.
